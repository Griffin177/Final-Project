# Final-Project
Final Project for INST126. Done by Griffin Biddle

#What the program does:
"""
This program is a short quiz that will tell the user what type of pokemon they most resemble. They will answer a series of questions,
and the results of the questions will then output a type of pokemon to the user. The possible outcomes include fire, water, grass and 
electric. Each question will have options a through d, a associating with fire, b with water, c with grass and d with eletric. Each 
answer selected to a question will add a tally to a certain type, and the type with the most tallies at the end of the quiz is the result
told to the user.
"""

#How to operate the program
"""
First, the user runs all of the code in the program. No lines can be missed. This can be done by highlighting everything, holding shift
and pressing return/enter. This puts all the code in the terminal. The user is then welcomed to the program and told that they need to
answer each question with one of the four answer choices. You can do this by entering a, b, c or d for each one, then pressing enter. It 
is not case sensetive, however you must answer with one of the listed letters. If anything else is entered you won't move to the next
question and will be prompted to type in a new answer. Answer each of the ten questions however you like, then you will be given your result. Your result will be the pokemon type you answered the most questions in favor of. For example, if you answered a the most, you will recieve a fire type as your result. If you tie between two results, you will be told there was a tie and given the two results. The user is then thanked for participating in the survey, and the program is finished. If the user wishes to take the quiz again, they can either rehighlight everything and do the shift and return/enter process again, or simply type personality_quiz() and press enter in the terminal.
