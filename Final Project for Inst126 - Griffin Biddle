#Small note about the counter function below, plus a reference:
"""
The counter function was found online thanks to: https://realpython.com/python-counter/. The entire code below relies on said function,
and without it, it wouldn't work properly. The credited site taught me how to import it and utilize it properly, so I just wanted to have 
it listed right at the top. I know we learned counter in class briefly, but I couldn't remember how to use it properly, hence the research 
and the listed source. - Griffin
